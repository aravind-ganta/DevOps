* Keep your .pem file in the “standard” location in .ssh directory in your $HOME. I.e. /Users/$USER/.ssh/. You should protect this directory with permission 400
* You should not share these .pem files with your co-workers. Each user should generate their own SSH keypair and their public key should be deployed to each system they need access to. Private keys should be private to each user, generated by them.
