### Linux File System

* File system is used to handle the data management of the storage
* The Linux file system has a hierarchical tree structure
* With 1 root folder

**Windows in comparison**
* Has multiple root folders
* C = internal hard drive

**EVERYTHING in Linux is a FILE**
  * Everything in the system is represented by a file descriptor
  * Text documents, pictures etc
  * Commands, like pwd, ls etc
  * Devices like printer, keyboard, usb
  * Even directories. Linux makes no difference between a file and a directory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files

**Users on OS**
  * Possible to have multiple user accounts on 1 computer
  * Each user has its own space
  * Each user can have own configurations

**Binary**
  * A binary is a computer readable format

**GUI vs CLI**
  * GUI = A graphical user interface, where we have graphical elements that you can interact with, like buttons
  * CLI = Command Line Interface, where users type in commands and see the results printed on the screen
  * Terminal = the GUI window that you see on the screen. It takes commands and shows output
  * On servers you only have the CLI, no GUI

**Why CLI over GUI?**
  * Work more efficient
  * Easier for bulk operations
  * CLI is more powerful

**Regular user vs root**
  * You can work as regular user or as a root

**sudo**
  * Allows regular users to run programs with the security privileges of the superuser or root
